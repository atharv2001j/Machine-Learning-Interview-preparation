    "- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are the two famous Machine Learning Algorithms which come under supervised learning technique. Since both the algorithms are of supervised in nature hence these algorithms use labeled dataset to make the predictions. But the main difference between them is how they are being used. The Linear Regression is used for solving Regression problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for solving the Classification problems. The description of both the algorithms is given below along with difference table."
