    "The Apriori algorithm uses frequent itemsets to generate association rules, and it is designed to work on the databases that contain transactions. With the help of these association rule, it determines how strongly or how weakly two objects are connected. This algorithm uses a breadth-first search and Hash Tree to calculate the itemset associations efficiently. It is the iterative process for finding the frequent itemsets from the large dataset.\n"
