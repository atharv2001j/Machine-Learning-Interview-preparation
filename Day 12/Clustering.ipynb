Such as the t-shirts are grouped in one section, and trousers are at other sections, similarly, at vegetable sections, apples, bananas, Mangoes, etc., are grouped in separate sections, so that we can easily find out the things. The clustering technique also works in the same way. Other examples of clustering are grouping documents according to the topic."

    "**2. Density-Based Clustering:**\n",

This algorithm does it by identifying different clusters in the dataset and connects the areas of high densities into clusters\n",
