    "1. **Supervised Learning Technique**: Logistic regression is a supervised learning algorithm, which means it requires labeled data for training. It is used for predicting a categorical dependent variable based on a set of independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Categorical Dependent Variable**: Logistic regression is suitable for predicting a categorical or discrete dependent variable. The categories can be binary, such as \"Yes\" or \"No,\" \"0\" or \"1,\" \"True\" or \"False,\" etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probabilistic Outputs**: Instead of providing binary 0 or 1 outcomes, logistic regression produces probabilistic values between 0 and 1. These probabilities represent the likelihood of the event being in a particular category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distinction from Linear Regression**: While logistic regression shares some similarities with linear regression, the key difference is in their applications. Linear regression is used for predicting continuous numeric values, while logistic regression is specifically designed for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **S-Shaped Logistic Function**: Logistic regression models use the logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to transform linear combinations of input features into a probability value between 0 and 1. The \"S\" shaped curve of the logistic function is used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"logistic.png\" alt=\"Working of Machine Learning\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Classification and Probability**: Logistic regression not only provides binary classification but also assigns probabilities to each category. This allows you to set a classification threshold to make decisions that balance precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Applications**: Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including medical diagnostics (e.g., cancer diagnosis), marketing (e.g., customer churn prediction), finance (e.g., credit risk assessment), and many more, where classifying data into discrete categories or estimating probabilities is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is a fundamental and versatile algorithm in the machine learning toolbox, often serving as a starting point for many classification tasks. It's a valuable tool for understanding the relationship between input features and the probability of a particular outcome."

    "1. **Sigmoid Function Purpose**:\n",
    "   - The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used in various applications, with a common use case in logistic regression.\n",
    "   - It is used to map the predicted values to probabilities, particularly in binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mapping to Probabilities**:\n",
    "   - The sigmoid function maps any real value to another value within a range of 0 and 1, making it suitable for representing probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range Limitation**:\n",
    "   - The primary characteristic of the sigmoid function is that it constrains its output within the range of 0 to 1.\n",
    "   - This constraint is essential in logistic regression, as the predicted values need to represent probabilities, which cannot exceed 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **S-Shape Curve**:\n",
    "   - The sigmoid function results in an \"S\"-shaped curve, resembling the letter \"S\" when plotted. This curve is why it's often referred to as the sigmoid function or the logistic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Threshold Value**:\n",
    "   - In logistic regression, a critical concept is the threshold value. This threshold defines the probability at which the model classifies an observation as belonging to one of the two classes (0 or 1).\n",
    "   - Values above the threshold tend to be classified as 1, and values below the threshold tend to be classified as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the sigmoid function is used to transform real-valued predictions into probabilities, and it plays a pivotal role in logistic regression by ensuring that predictions are confined to the range of 0 to 1, making it possible to set a threshold for classification decisions."

    "The above graph shows the test set result. As we can see, the graph is divided into two regions (Purple and Green). And Green observations are in the green region, and Purple observations are in the purple region. So we can say it is a good prediction and model. Some of the green and purple data points are in different regions, which can be ignored as we have already calculated this error using the confusion matrix (11 Incorrect output).\n",
